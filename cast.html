							<br>
							Harrod is the best friend anyone could ask for! He's kind, loyal, and always down to do something. He tends to cling to people he likes, relying on them for emotional stability. He's a bit dumber than most, but he doesn't let that stop him from planning and executing convoluted schemes.&nbsp;</p>

							<em>Female - Fox - 25 - <a href="https://normalsville.the-comic.org/comics/1/#content-start">First Appearance</a></em><br>
							As Harrod's longtime roommate and best friend, Zoey finds herself beset by problems wherever she goes. She's grumpy and jaded, maybe due to her failure to live out her dreams. Ultimately she's a nice person, although her good intentions tend to get lost under a sarcastic tone. She's currently dating Amber.
